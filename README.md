# Hybrid-SwinV2-TransformerCNN-BrainTumorDetection
Implementation of a Hybrid SwinV2 Transformer + CNN architecture for multi-class brain tumor MRI classification. The model fuses global self-attention with local convolutional features, achieving 97% accuracy on benchmark datasets and supporting real-time inference via a PyQt5 GUI.
